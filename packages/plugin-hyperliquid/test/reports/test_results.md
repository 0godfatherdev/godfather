### Issues Identified
1. Order Flow Test Failure:
   - Issue with order cancellation functionality
   - API returning 422 error during order cancellation
   - Deserialization error in JSON response

2. Exchange Actions Error Test Failure:
   - Non-existent order error handling not working as expected
   - Receiving 422 status code instead of proper 'Order not found' error
   - API response format mismatch with expectations

### Recommendations
1. Investigate order cancellation API integration:
   - Review request format for order cancellation
   - Verify JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Check error handling in the API client

2. Update error handling in exchange actions:
   - Align error messages with API response format
   - Improve error parsing for 422 status codes
   - Consider updating test expectations to match actual API behavior
