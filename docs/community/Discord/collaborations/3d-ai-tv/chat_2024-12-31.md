## Summary
The chat segment focused on the development of a 'gaze and lookats' animation technique, which involves characters looking towards each other in their scene setup using either video or live camera feed. Boom is working on this project but mentioned potential challenges with audio background noise during conversations between animated characters.

## FAQ
- Can I override bad Z fighting in the shader code? How can this be achieved? asked by @boom (07:04)
- Is it a video or live camera feed on that pipe for gaze/lookat feature implementation? What is being set up currently? (06:55) asked by @SM Sith Lord
- How can we toggle and disable a method? What is the purpose of this action in our game's context? asked by [boom] (07:29)
- Do characters consider who they are speaking to when deciding their gaze direction, or should it be random for now? asked by [SM Sith Lord](07:31)
- Can we reuse IDs? Are they saved in local storage and remembered by the system? ðŸ¤” (@SM Sith Lord, @07:38) (Yes) asked by @boom
