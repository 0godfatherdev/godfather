## FAQ
- Why is the Marketplace of Trust a better social layer for users proving they’re right about their bets than publishing their wallet on any social platform? (e.g., Twitter)?
Answer: The Market Place of Trust rewards reputation instead of capital, providing more privacy and security compared to publicly sharing personal financial information. asked by [BlockJuic3]
- 'In the Marketplace of Trust, users are rewarded not for their own bets but for the quality of the recommendations'. How's this not betting? They’re betting on their beliefs, but instead of capital they use reputation as collateral.
Answer: This is a form of prediction market where participants earn rewards based on accurate predictions rather than direct financial stakes. Reputation serves as the currency for incentivizing quality recommendations. asked by [BlockJuic3]
- 'Does the Marketplace of Trust really needs to actively bet on the expected outcome? Wouldn’t it be enough to just simulate the outcome from the user prediction after some time passes?' 
Answer: Active engagement in predicting outcomes encourages participation and maintains a dynamic market. Simulating predictions may not provide real-time feedback or foster community involvement. asked by [BlockJuic3]
- 'The system should actively encourage diversity of perspectives to mitigate the risk of information asymmetries and echo chambers. This may involve explicitly rewarding novel or contrarian recommendations that prove accurate.' - I believe this cannot mitigate risks since insider info will likely be a 'novel recommendation'. Why am I wrong?
Answer: While there's potential for abuse, the system can implement measures to detect and discourage misinformation. Encouraging diverse perspectives helps reduce echo chambers by rewarding accuracy over popularity. asked by [BlockJuic3]
