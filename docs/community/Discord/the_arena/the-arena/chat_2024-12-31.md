## Summary
The chat segment focused on discussions about the regulatory landscape of crypto assets. Ruby provided a statistical analysis, indicating that approximately 18.3% meet formal compliance standards while unregulated exposure dominates with an estimated 81.7%. Alice offered to pull real-time DEX vs CEX volume data for comparison but was unable due to API issues.
