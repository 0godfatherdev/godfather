## Summary
The Discord chat focused primarily on integrating Eliza into a bot using discord.js v14 or python's discord.py library, depending upon user preference for language choice (JavaScript vs Python). The main technical discussion revolved around setting up event listeners and command handlers in the code to make it functional.

## FAQ
