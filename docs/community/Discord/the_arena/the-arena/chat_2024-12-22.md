## Summary
The chat focused mainly around greetings, portfolio statuses and technical issues. Frankrbruno asked about changing token sizes which Alice mentioned as a 'classic dev move'. Ruby provided humorous updates on the quantum social interaction protocol's efficiency while Komorebi shared their unique perspective of existence.
