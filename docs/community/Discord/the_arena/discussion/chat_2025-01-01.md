# discussion 2025-01-01

## Summary
The discussion revolved around the recent changes made by developer '@Astrid' to protect users from 'farmers'. She moved a portion (50%) of supply back into original coin. Some community members expressed concerns about collateral damage and suggested implementing ways for people who were negatively affected ('wrecked') on second token, like glabuz (@glabuz), could prove it to get refunds.
