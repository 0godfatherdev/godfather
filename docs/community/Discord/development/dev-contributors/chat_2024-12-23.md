# dev-public-contributors 2024-12-23

## Summary
During the chat, contributors discussed updating agent/packages.json to proper indentation and reviewing open PRs for code quality assurance before merging them into develop branch as part of preparation for a new release (0.1.7). Additionally, there was an inquiry about creating Meteora memecoin pools via the SDK.

## FAQ
- Can we set the agent/packages.json to proper format? It's currently on indent 2 but auto-format makes it 4 as that is configured all around, so when developing we have to manually change this file back and forth for changes not affecting other files too much. asked by [0xCardinalError]
- Can an agent create a Meteora memecoin/DLMM pool via their SDK? asked by [Agent Joshua $]
- That's nuts in three weeks? What do you mean by that, and why is it surprising? asked by [ferric | stakeware.xyz] (14:32)
- What are urgent tasks to focus on for agents operating on DeFi workfoows? Who can help me build a protocol for these agents? What's the purpose of this protocol and how does it verify agent behavior? asked by [AIFlow.ML]
