# dev-public-contributors 2024-12-16

## Summary
The primary technical discussion revolved around updating the GitHub action for exporting contribution summaries. Jin mentioned pushing updates to relevant files and seeking assistance with adding a login feature, wallet address or Discord name in 'scripts/build.js', 'dist/generate_site.json' & 'data/contributors.json'. The conversation also touched upon exploring the Greptile platform for potential collaboration.

## FAQ
- Is the call we're on now different from this? Was the `Eliza Framework Council` call spur of the moment? (14:53)? asked by @YoungPhlo
- How did Craig do in his last attempt at mapping audio speaker by speaker, and was it successful?(15:27) asked by @jin
- Does the proposed flow of linking GitHub and Discord accounts make sense? Can we host it on existing servers instead of adding a new one, then push PoC to Github for review? What are your thoughts about having discord bot handle entire registration process or just link between platforms? Is there any way tip.cc can get information from collabland? asked by [Agent Joshua]₱ | TEE (16:04)
- Should we do linking with Discord and GitHub, sign in through one of them to the other, or just use Github? Is it necessary for contributors to have a discord account long-term? asked by [jin] (16:24)
