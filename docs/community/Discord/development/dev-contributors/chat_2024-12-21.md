# dev-public-contributors 2024-12-21

## Summary
The main technical discussions in the chat segment revolved around porting Langchain wrapper from Solidity to Python, with @AIFlow.ML requesting a link containing all relevant documentation about the project and its resources. Additionally, there was discussion on tag definitions for contributor analysis by @0x8664.

## FAQ
- What is the Eliza's codebase? What are some recent PRs I can check out? asked by @jin
- For parity with tag definitions, should any other tags be considered for @jin to include in his analysis of contributors on https://github.com/ai16z? What about the autolabeler? asked by @0x8664
- Thoughts on auto docs? https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1110#issuecomment-2558287157 asked by jin (17:02)
- Should knowledge be separate from memories? Thinking about using a folder for character-specific MD files. asked by [Ninja_Dev (17:20), jin (17:34)]
- Should I format all GitHub updates as markdown? What are the benefits of using Markdown over JSON for LLM providers? asked by jin (17:25)
- How should knowledge be stored and accessed within agents to allow dynamic updating without affecting all instances simultaneously? Should we use a shared folder or individual folders keyed by UUID/character name? asked by [NinjaDev, Odilitime]
- 'Separating knowledge from memory would require two queries instead of one. Is this better for scale and real-time pipelines?', 'Ninja_Dev' answered that it makes sense, but also highlighted the issue with injecting full data on a query. asked by [Odilitime]

## Help Interactions
- @Odilitime helped @AIFlow.ML with Providing documentation for Eliza's codebase
- jin (17:34) helped [Ninja_Dev, jin] with Implementing a new system to manage knowledge and make it more adaptable.
- [jin] helped [Odilitime, NinjaDev], with Discussing best practices on storing character definitions in `.ts` files instead of JSON.
- [Odilitime] helped [Ninja_Dev] with 'Separating knowledge from memory would require two queries instead of one. Is this better for scale and real-time pipelines?'
- @Odilitime helped @ShakkerNerd with Discussing and identifying issues related to closing of pull requests on develop branch.
