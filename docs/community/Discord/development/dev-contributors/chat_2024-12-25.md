## Summary
The Discord chat segment focused on discussions around Multi-Agent Shared Knowledge and its implementation. A bug was identified with different models used by tiktoken for tokenization which affects the generateObject function, leading to a decision of using deprecated methods until resolved (0xCardinalError). Odilitime mentioned merging conflicts during Mondays' development work but planned on handling them effectively throughout this week due to Christmas holidays. cjft shared progress in implementing dynamic imports for coinbase multiple import situations and aimed at reducing runtime memory by 90%. The team also discussed new features using autonomous AI Agents, including self-posting updates within TG/Discord communities (꧁Ninja_Dev꧂).

## FAQ
- What is the general issue with merging to develop on Mondays? And what's different this week being an odd one? asked by [Odilitime]
- Are we still doing merges only for development work, or is it also applicable to the main branch? Or was that just a different approach? asked by [꧁Ninja_Dev꧂ (10:20)]
- What's your plan regarding conflict resolution during this week when you merge and test in the first half of the day, considering people have time off around Christmas? How will it affect memory reduction efforts? asked by [Odilitime]
- When will the robot hive mind be ready? (21:31) - rhetorical question, no meaningful response. asked by ferric | stakeware.xyz
- Is this PR review-ready now?: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1383 (21:59) - Yes, it's ready for a review after resolving duplicate imports issue. asked by cjft
