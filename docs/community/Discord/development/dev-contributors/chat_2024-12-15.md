# dev-public-contributors 2024-12-15

## Summary
The Discord chat segment focused on improving technical processes, such as incorporating reviewer feedback into JSON scripts for code reviews. Suggestions were made to expand CI PR title check options and analyze PR titles/descriptions using AI ontologies about the organization's coding practices.

## FAQ
- How can we incorporate the reviewer side of things into our JSON script? (PR review, comments and merges) asked by @0x8664
- What are some suggestions for creating AI agents that understand their own code? asked by @jin
- Should we consider adding an analyze feature to check the PR's title/PR description? (to deduce subject area and make it required) asked by @0x8664
- What is being done in PR1125 & PR1126? asked by @Ninja_Devê§‚
- i'm assuming for fixes, i create pr against main and not develop? - should I fix the build too if needed ? ðŸ˜‚ (20:34) #discord-community#contributors_v1.5/chatmessage asked by hosermage
- Against develop and not main - should I fix the build too if needed ? ðŸ˜‚ (20:34) #discord-community#contributors_v1.5/chatmessage asked by [Agent Joshua $]

- What can we learn from what happened with AutoGPT? asked by [YoungPhlo](21:21)

## Action Items

### Technical Tasks
- Incorporate reviewer side of things into JSON script, including PR review comments, merges, Issue comments mentioned by @0x8664
- Develop a small handmade ontology about code, then use AI to grow the ontology over time and add entries. Assess accuracy of new entries. mentioned by @jin
- Create a simplified version for fetching data using `gh` CLI tool in GitHub Actions runners, as suggested by @0x8664. mentioned by @jin
- Develop a contributor data structure for GitHub mentioned by [jin (20:28), jin (20:29)]

### Documentation Needs
- Clean up and document existing scripts for better understanding of the codebase. Suggested by @jin at 18:54 UTC. mentioned by @jin
- Share a README for core embeddings stuff mentioned by [jin](20:31)

### Feature Requests
- Expand CI PR title check options to be more granular and make it required for merge approval. mentioned by @0x8664
- Consider adding an analyze feature that checks the PR's title/PR description to deduce subject area and make it required for merge approval. mentioned by @0x8664
- Implement an AI-based scoring system for contributors mentioned by [hosermage (20:30), jin]
- Collaborate with Gitcoin on the project, focusing on DAO coordination and rewarding work. mentioned by [jin](20:35)
