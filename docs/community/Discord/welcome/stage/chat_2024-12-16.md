## Summary
The Eliza Framework Council discussed incorporating AI Dev School summaries into their documentation, with an emphasis on presenting them in an accessible yet informative manner. Cottenio proposed adding a 'How To Contribute' button featuring options for donations/buying $AI16z and partnerships to the new site (https://elizaos.ai). The conversation also touched upon minspec requirements when loading cloud instances, as well as considerations around wallet actions abstraction.
