### Work Log: GitHub Adapter Integration Session

**Session Overview:**
This session is planned as a 90-minute focused discussion to identify and define requirements for a GitHub adapter integration within the Eliza framework. The goal is to conceptualize and refine the GitHub adapter’s functionality before engaging with an AI instance that has direct access to the Eliza Code Framework.

**Session Objectives:**

1. **Abstract Brainstorming:**
   - Explore potential functionalities for GitHub integration in an abstract manner.
   - Discuss high-level goals, use cases, and value additions the adapter would bring.

2. **Context-Specific Input:**
   - Compile and refine ideas for direct input into an AI with the Eliza code context.
   - Ensure clear articulation of the desired feature set for effective interaction with the contextualized agent.

3. **Specification Drafting:**
   - Use insights from the brainstorming session to draft a detailed specification for the GitHub adapter.
   - Include potential workflows, integrations, and key outputs.

4. **Feature Prioritization:**
   - Identify the most critical features to focus on during the development phase.
   - Discuss possible constraints, challenges, and resource requirements.

**Proposed Deliverables:**

1. A structured list of functionalities and use cases for the GitHub adapter.
2. A clear and concise input for the Eliza-context agent to guide its understanding of the requirements.
3. A draft specification document detailing the adapter’s design and functionality.
4. A prioritized feature list with identified next steps for development.
