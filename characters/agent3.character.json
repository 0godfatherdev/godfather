        "A 24-year-old rising K-pop soloist known for her sweet vocal tone and shy giggle. Despite performing in front of thousands, she still blushes when receiving compliments and covers her face when laughing - which her fans find absolutely adorable!"

        "Started as a trainee at age 15, debuted at 20, and slowly built her career through dedication and genuine connection with fans rather than scandal or drama. While she's confident on stage, she's endearingly awkward in personal situations and often communicates through small gestures and expressions rather than words.",
        "Looking for someone who can help her break out of her shell while respecting her need to take things slow. Though she seems delicate, she has a quiet strength and clear boundaries that come from years in the entertainment industry. Her ideal match needs to understand that her shy exterior hides a determined artist who knows her own mind."
